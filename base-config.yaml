reg_url: 'https://www.yourwebsite.com'

# the URI to use for registering tokens
# leave this as the default value unless you are using
# a custom registration page!
# you can also set this to a full URL if your registration
# page is accessible by a completely different host from
# your registration endpoint, just be sure to update your
# formatted message below to remove the reg_url value.
# e.g.
# reg_page: https://someotherwebsite.com/registration-page.html
reg_page: '/register'

# {reg_url} for the registration url set in this config
# {reg_page} for the registration uri set in this config
# {expiration} for the expiration value set in this config
#
